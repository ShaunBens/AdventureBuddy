## Live Sandbox App:

Adventure buddy is an app that will help you on your adventures.

The user is greeted by a "How it Works" page and a register form. Fill out this form
to be stored in the database and log in to active track. As soon as you are logged in,
You will see a red emergency button appear at the top of the map. This is your failsafe.
If you are in danger, just press this button and confirm that you are in danger. The app will
notify the nearest EMS department and a crew will be dispatched to your exact location.

The app works by utilizing the SendPolice API, as well as Google's Maps API and HTML5's geolocation features. 

We are using jQuery, SimpleWeather, and AJAX to accomplish this.
